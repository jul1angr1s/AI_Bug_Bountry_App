  EIP-7702 Smart Account Transaction Batching for x.402 Payment Flow
  - useSmartAccountBatching hook using wagmi useSendCalls/useCapabilities/useCallsStatus
  - PaymentRequiredModal integration with 1-click approve+transfer for EIP-7702 wallets
  - Graceful fallback to existing 2-step flow for non-delegated wallets
  - No new dependencies required (wagmi v3.4.1 ships with ERC-5792 hooks)
