# Archive Reason

**Status**: Completed and fully implemented
**Archived**: 2026-02-16
**Replaced By**: N/A (living spec at `openspec/specs/manual-e2e-testing.md`)

## Why Archived

The formal Manual E2E Testing Workflow specification was created and is now a base spec in `openspec/specs/manual-e2e-testing.md`. The 60-90 minute pre-demonstration testing procedure covers prerequisites validation, service startup, agent registration, protocol registration, scan execution, validator testing, and payment processing.

## Key Outcomes

- Created `openspec/specs/manual-e2e-testing.md` base specification
- Consolidated Phase 4 testing procedures from validation reports
- Referenced from `openspec/specs/testing.md` E2E section
- Serves as blueprint for automated E2E test development
