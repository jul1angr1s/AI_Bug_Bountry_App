notes: |
  This change creates a new base specification (openspec/specs/manual-e2e-testing.md)
  that formalizes the Phase 4 manual end-to-end testing workflow documented in
  VALIDATION_REPORT.md and Improvement_plan.md. The workflow is critical for
  validating system readiness before demonstrations and production deployment.
